/**
 * @brief The NetEvent class
 * Class used to communicate between the server and the
 * client.
 *
 * Provides a mean to notify the user about connexion
 * event. Some of these events can be generated by the implementation
 * of the server/client interface. Some other are only generated
 * expicitely by the client.
 * NetEvent will be handled in a particular way both by the client and the server.
 * The particular behaviours are the following :
 *  - SERV_TRY(resp CLI_TRY) will not be passed to the user when they are received. A
 *  - SERV_RESP(resp CLI_RESP) message will be directly answered, the message is then discarded
 *  - PLAYER_JOIN : the content of the message will be used to identify the Player in the future.
 *  - ACK messages are only used internally and shoud not be sent. They are always discarded.
