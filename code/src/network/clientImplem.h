/**
 * @brief The ClientImplem class
 *  Class implementing the Client interface. It is used for communication
 *  between the server and the Client.
 *  This class relies on UDP protocol for communication. A custom protocol is
 *  added on top of UDP to ensure packet delivery when it is necessary (basically,
 *  when the client sends an event to the server).
 *
 *  This class uses asynchronous send/recieve, and stores eventually the results.
 *  This is necessary to ACK messages, and to resend thoses who have not been recieved.
 *  Because it is asynchronous, it requires a thread running background operations
 *  (send, recieve, resend, ack...).
 *
 *  The messages that will be sent must have this form :
 *  - a header containing the type of the message (8 bits), the message number (used to identify messages, 4 bits)
 *  and wether it should be acked or not (1 bit).
 *  - data : provided by the toString method of the message
 *
 *  In pariticular, the size of the message sent is not sent. This is possible because
 *  we use a datagram oriented protocol. For this protocol to work, it is important that
 *  messages can be sent in only one datagram (and it should be checked that it is
 *  effectively the case).
